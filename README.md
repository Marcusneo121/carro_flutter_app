# Carro Flutter App

Carro is a P2P Car Sharing Platform. If you go through my repos, you had probably seen similar Flutter app from few years ago. YES! Its a similar app.

The reason I am re-writing the same app is because I am trying to create my own Backend APIs to replace the old Carro app which used Firebase + Brush up my flutter with project from scratch.

Therefore, this project is mainly a showcase of how the APIs work. The main focus is the Backend.


- Backend Framework: Adonis JS
- Database : PostgreSQL
- ORM : LucidORM


## Roadmap

- Deployment / CICD of the Flutter app
- Deployment of the Backend
- Database hosting for Backend
- Build a web app with Next.js (hopefully)
- ^^^ will add as the project grow^^^


## Features

Some pretty basic feature, mainly focus on backend. This is just a showcase.

- Light/dark mode
- Add cars to favourite
- Bargain car renting price
- Search cars
- ^^^more to come^^^
